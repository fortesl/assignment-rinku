Build a list/detail application in AngularJs (angular 1)

The list view should list cars by model/year/price. Clicking on a car model should bring the detail view for the car 
which should include additional details like description and image. Clicking the back button in detail view should
navigate back to list view.

Use your knowledge of Angular MVC 
Model - service to provide data, add http calls to json data files for extra credit. if not hard code data in service
View - HTML, CSS, angular directives
Controller - serve data to bind to view elements

Fork the project, add your code, and submit via pull request.
